What is more important: rushing to complete as many cards as possible? Or making sure you fully understand the work? And Why?

answ:
What is important is to make sure that i fully understand the work, theres no point in rushing and finish all the cards when you know nothing or do not understand.You wont be learning anything or grasping the skill if your main focus is finishing up the cards
